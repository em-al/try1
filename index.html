	<h1> Les As de la Jungle Ã  la rescousse</h1>

	<p> Allons-y! New-new-Doctor. What? What?! WHAT?! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.

	Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. </p>
